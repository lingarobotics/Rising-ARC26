## 📊 WEEKLY SNAPSHOT (From Notion)

- **Status (% range):** 31–60%  
- **Focus Quality (number):** 3 / 5  
- **Discipline Score (number):** 6 / 10  

---

## 🧠 WHAT I LEARNED

- **One concept that truly clicked:**  
  How Java programs are structured, compiled, and executed within the Java ecosystem

- **One confusion / weak area remaining:**  
  Higher Order Functions in JavaScript — needs a slower first-pass understanding

---

## 🔁 SELF-CORRECTION (Sunday Night)

- **Where I drifted from the plan:**  
  Skipped DSA and Cloud; frontend scope required more cognitive effort than expected

- **Root cause (energy / time / overload):**  
  Mental fatigue and poor energy allocation toward the end of the week

- **One concrete rule for next week:**  
  DSA limited to exactly one clearly defined concept with problems; Cloud limited to one clearly defined concept only

## 🔒 WEEK CLOSURE

- **Review completed on:** January 18, 2025 — 11:15 PM  
- **Notes:**  
  Week 1 validated the ARC26 system. Focus going forward is correction, not acceleration.

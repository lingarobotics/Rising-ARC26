**Duration:** Week 2  
**Lifecycle:** Executed & Reviewed

---

## 🧭 EXPECTED (Planned Before Week Starts)

### Frontend
- **Planned focus:**  
  JavaScript Higher Order Functions and DOM Manipulation
- **Clear stopping point:**  
  HOF completion and first 20 steps of DOM Manipulation

### Backend (Java)
- **Planned topics / lectures:**  
  - NPTEL IIT Kharagpur:  
    Lecture 06 (Demonstration-II), Lecture 07 (Encapsulation), Lecture 08 (Demonstration-III)  
  - Scaler Java: Arrays, Strings, Functions, Multidimensional Arrays
- **Expected understanding level:**  
  Conceptual clarity with basic implementation ability

### DSA
- **Planned topic:**  
  Arrays (core fundamentals)
- **Number of problems planned:**  
  2 (1 easy + 1 medium)
- **Problem source:**  
  Standard DSA practice platforms
- **Problem focus (optional):**  
  Traversal, indexing, basic operations (insert, delete, update)

### Cloud
- **Planned focus:**  
  OCI fundamentals — Introduction, IAM, Networking
- **Clear stopping point:**  
  Completion of IAM and Networking modules with skill checks

### Project
- **Planned task:**  
  Release Version 2.0 with Fast Learn mode and Core Point feature
- **Expected outcome (small & shippable):**  
  Stable v2.0 release deployed and documented

## 📊 WEEKLY SNAPSHOT (From Notion)

- **Status (% range):** 61–90
- **Focus Quality:** 3 / 5
- **Discipline Score:** 7 / 10

---

## 🧠 WHAT I LEARNED

- **One concept that truly clicked:**  
  How abstraction through Higher Order Functions and strong array fundamentals (searching and sorting) improve problem-solving across frontend and DSA.

- **One confusion / weak area remaining:**  
  Practical depth in DOM Manipulation and incomplete closure of OCI IAM and Networking concepts.

---

## 🔁 SELF-CORRECTION (Sunday Night)

- **Where I drifted from the plan:**  
  DOM Manipulation and OCI Cloud topics were started but not completed to the planned stopping points.

- **Root cause (energy / time / overload):**  
  Context switching and lack of immediate reallocation after discarding outdated resources.

- **One concrete rule for next week:**  
  No topic is considered complete unless its core concepts and closure checkpoints (practice or skill check) are finished before moving on.

## 🔒 WEEK CLOSURE

- **Review completed on:** Sunday, Week 2
- **Notes (if any):**  
  Project-only Sundays validated. Cloud and Frontend require stricter closure discipline in upcoming weeks.

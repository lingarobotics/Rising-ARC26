## 🧠 WHAT I LEARNED

- **One concept that truly clicked:**  
  System deployment and integration are efficient when architectural boundaries are already defined.
- **One confusion / weak area remaining:**  
  Maintaining discipline to execute learning tracks alongside project work.

---

## 🔁 SELF-CORRECTION (Sunday Night)

- **Where I drifted from the plan:**  
  Frontend, Java, DSA, and Cloud learning were skipped.
- **Root cause (energy / time / overload):**  
  Tunnel vision toward project execution.
- **One concrete rule for next week:**  
  No project work unless at least one planned learning block is completed first.

  End of Week 04
- **Notes (if any):**  
  Second consecutive project-heavy week. Pattern identified and correction rule enforced for Week 05.

# Rising ARC26

**Rising ARC26** is a 50-week personal learning journey focused on disciplined skill development, long-term consistency, and reflective improvement.

This repository documents my weekly progress from a **learning-first perspective**, rather than a results-first or hype-driven approach.

The goal is not to showcase perfection, but to demonstrate **process, thinking clarity, and sustained effort over time**.

## Why This Repository Exists

Most student portfolios tend to show:
- Rushed projects  
- Shallow explanations  
- Short bursts of motivation  

**Rising ARC26 exists to show something different:**
- How I learn  
- How I struggle  
- How I correct myself  
- How consistency compounds over time  

Each week is treated as a **unit of growth**, logged honestly and reviewed intentionally.

  - Used only to apply **already understood concepts**
  - No rushed or copy-driven implementations

## Philosophy Behind ARC26

- Consistency over intensity  
- Understanding over speed  
- Reflection over blind repetition  
- Systems over shortcuts  

Slow weeks, confusion, and mistakes are treated as **part of the process**, not failures.

Progress is evaluated **weekly**, not emotionally day-to-day.

## How This Repository Should Be Read

This repository is **not a tutorial** and **not a daily journal**.

It is meant to be:
- Skimmed across weeks  
- Compared at different stages  
- Discussed in interviews or mentorship conversations  

Interviewers or reviewers are encouraged to:
- Open any two distant weeks  
- Observe how thinking, clarity, and focus evolve over time

## Note on Authenticity

All entries are written by me, based on what I genuinely learned and struggled with during that week.

No entries are optimized for trends, algorithms, or external validation.

## Timeline

- **Duration:** 50 weeks  
- **Logging frequency:** Weekly  
- **Tracking method:** Markdown documentation

## Closing Note

Rising ARC26 is not about proving that I know everything.

It is about proving that I can:
- Commit long-term  
- Learn deliberately  
- Reflect honestly  
- Improve systematically  

That, to me, is real growth.

# Rising ARC26

Rising ARC26 is a **50-week personal learning journey** focused on disciplined skill development, long-term consistency, and reflective improvement.

This repository documents my weekly progress from a **learning-first perspective**, rather than a results-first or hype-driven approach.

The goal is not to showcase perfection, but to demonstrate **process, thinking clarity, and sustained effort over time**.

## Why This Repository Exists

Most student portfolios show:
- rushed projects
- shallow explanations
- short bursts of motivation

Rising ARC26 exists to show something different:
- how I learn
- how I struggle
- how I correct myself
- how consistency compounds over time

Each week is treated as a **unit of growth**, logged honestly and reviewed intentionally.

---

## Structure of the Repository

Each week has its own markdown file:

WEEK01.md
WEEK02.md
...
WEEK50.md

--- 

Every weekly file follows the same structure:
- what I learned
- mistakes or difficulties faced
- concrete improvements planned
- one concept I can now explain clearly

This makes progress **traceable and comparable** across time.

---

## Areas Covered

Depending on the week, learning may include:

- **Frontend Development**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React fundamentals

- **Backend Development (Java)**
  - Core Java, OOP, problem-solving, backend concepts

- **Database Concepts**
  - SQL, relational thinking, data modeling (when applicable)

- **DSA**
  - Logical thinking, problem decomposition, fundamentals

- **Projects**
  - Small, controlled projects used to apply already-understood concepts

Not every area appears every week.  
Focus is intentional and limited to avoid dilution.

## Philosophy Behind ARC26

- Consistency over intensity  
- Understanding over speed  
- Reflection over blind repetition  
- Systems over shortcuts  

Failures, slow weeks, and confusion are considered **part of the process**, not deviations from it.

Progress is evaluated weekly, not emotionally day-to-day.

## How This Repository Should Be Read

This repository is **not a tutorial** and **not a daily journal**.

It is meant to be:
- skimmed across weeks
- compared at different stages
- discussed in interviews or mentorship conversations

Interviewers or reviewers are encouraged to:
- open any two distant weeks
- observe how thinking, clarity, and focus evolve

---

## Note on Authenticity

All entries are written by me, based on what I genuinely learned and struggled with during that week.

No entries are optimized for trends, algorithms, or external validation.

---

## Timeline

- Duration: 50 weeks
- Logging frequency: Weekly
- Tracking method: Markdown documentation

---

## Closing Note

Rising ARC26 is not about proving that I know everything.

It is about proving that I can:
- commit long-term
- learn deliberately
- reflect honestly
- improve systematically

That, to me, is real growth.

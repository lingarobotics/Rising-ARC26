## 🧠 WHAT I LEARNED

- **One concept that truly clicked:**  
  Designing a learning system that prioritizes reasoning, execution-flow awareness, and self-verification over passive content consumption.

- **One confusion / weak area remaining:**  
  Maintaining balance between deep project focus and parallel learning tracks.

---

## 🔁 SELF-CORRECTION (Sunday Night)

- **Where I drifted from the plan:**  
  Frontend, Java, DSA, and Cloud were completely skipped.

- **Root cause (energy / time / overload):**  
  Tunnel vision into project execution caused neglect of scheduled learning blocks.

- **One concrete rule for next week:**  
  **No project work until at least one learning block is completed that day.**

  End of Week 3

- **Notes:**  
  Project-heavy week. System imbalance identified. Correction rule defined for Week 4.
